## Klondike Deal 3 in Python 3.4 ##

12/18/15 - deals, moves cards, tells when won

To-Do:
 - make rules for what cards can go where
	- descending
	- alternating color
	- only kings on open spaces
	- only up on foundation piles
 - waste pile displays top 3 instead of the number in that set
 - allow for more than 10 stacks of cards to be moved
 -
